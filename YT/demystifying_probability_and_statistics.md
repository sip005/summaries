# [Demystifying Probability and Statistics: A 5-Minute Explainer](https://youtu.be/6DiOJ12Udc8?si=0YQsTbgkfv2Yhu7q)  

Here we aim to answer mainly three questions.

1. What is Probability?  

2. What is Statistics?  

3. How are the two feilds related?  

In order to answer these questions we will take a look at an example 

We have a transperant jar with marbels, when we pick a marbel what is the probability or chance that we will pick a red marbel. Conversely we have a opaque cup and we have already pulled out blue, green and red marbel, that all we had access to now the question is what is the content of this particular cup

which question will fall under probability and which one will fall under statistics
