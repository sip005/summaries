# [Demystifying Probability and Statistics: A 5-Minute Explainer](https://youtu.be/6DiOJ12Udc8?si=0YQsTbgkfv2Yhu7q)  

Here we aim to answer mainly three questions.

1. What is Probability?  

2. What is Statistics?  

3. How are the two feilds related?  

In order to answer these questions we will take a look at an example 

1. We have a transperant jar with marbels, when we pick a marbel what is the probability or chance that we will pick a red marbel next time from the jar.  

2. Conversely we have a opaque cup and we have already pulled out blue, green and red marbel, that all we had access to now the question is what do we think is the content of this particular cup

which question will fall under probability and which one will fall under statistics

the first question will fall under probability, cause there we were already provided with a model, a probabilistic model, some system some application, In this particular case simply a jar filled with marbels. we were asked the chance of associated outcome. 

So, In probability we are usually given a form of model, we are ansering probabistic chance related question around that system based on context.


In statistics we dont know the underlying model or system application, we do have access to some data points, some observations, some past outcomes. Form that we are trying to figure out the model those observations are generated from. 

IN probability - we are given a model for a particular system or application what is ubknown is the associated outcomes, we are trying predicting the outcomes

conversely  

In Statistics ourcomes from the past that are known to us, now we are trying to do is infer an underlying model, here the underlying is unknown, this is what the model is probabilic to us.  


|          | Probability |    Statistics    |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Known    |    Model    | Outcomes(past)   |
| Unknown  |   Outcome   | model(Uncertain) |


Why we bundle these terms together  

Most cases we are asked probabilistic questions?

Probability Theory --> Probabilistic Model --> Probabilic question

statistics helps us to comeup with models to answer out probabilitic chance related question and the statistical models are usually based upon probability theory


In Probability, a model informs the likilihood of an outcome   

In statistics, observations are used to reason a model.  

We are generally interested in answering probabilistic question
